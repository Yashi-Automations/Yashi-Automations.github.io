FS10-R
A high-speed microprocessor based fire detection and process control system specially designed for liquid and powder coating applications, the FS System 10™ quickly detects the presence of a flame, reacts by initiating a shutdown of the electrostatic finishing process in a matter of milliseconds; and effectively interrupts the fire before residues and wet paint films can ignite.
Features & Benefits
Multi-spectral digital electro-optical infrared fire detector
Meets requirements of NFPA 33
Unique two-stage ALERT and FIRE ALARM response
Quick Specs
Immune to false alarms caused by arcs or corona discharges
Built-in automatic "through the lens" self-test
Not sensitive to background radiant energy sources such as paint heaters
